# GemstoneGuardian
This is a relatively large project I took on for a class I am taking at NTNU, and is called Gemstone Guardian (GG). GG is heavily inspired by role-playing-games (RPGs) such as pokémon, especially the early ones like Pokémon Red and Blue. 

You play as a boy that uncovers one of his grandmas greatest secrets: that she holds an elemental gemstone: a gemstone with special powers. Using said gemstone you fight all kinds of people, whomst also carry such stones, to become the very greatest carrier. 

# How to play
To start the game you run the app.java file.
You use WASD to move around, and space/mouseclick to battle and talk to people.
